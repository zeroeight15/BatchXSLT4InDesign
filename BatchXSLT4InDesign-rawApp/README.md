# The BatchXSLT4InDesign App Package
The archive 'BatchXSLT4InDesign-rawApp' contains an entire 'raw' folder structure of the 'BatchXSLT4InDesign' Application.

Download and un-zip it.

Copy a compiled 'BatchXSLT.app' into the folder 'BatchXSLT4InDesign-rawApp/BatchXSLT/' (right beside the contained autostart.jt).\
The dummy folder named 'Replace with compiled BatchXSLT.app' can be deleted.

If you want the Mac App (contains a Java VM for MacOS) then you may delete the file 'BatchXSLT.bat' (this is the starter for Windows).

If you want the Windows app (contains a Java VM for Windows) you may delete the file 'BatchXSLT.sh'. Start BatchXSLT with a double-click on 'BatchXSLT.bat'.

If you have not included a Java Virtual Machine in the compiled bundle, then make sure Java is installed on you machine.

Now rename the folder 'BatchXSLT4InDesign-rawApp' to 'BatchXSLT4InDesign' and copy it into the 'Applications' folder.\
Same procedure for Windows or Mac OS X.

The transformer is ready.
