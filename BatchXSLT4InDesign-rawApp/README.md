The archive 'BatchXSLT4InDesign-rawApp' contains an entire 'raw' folder structure of the 'BatchXSLT4InDesign' Application.

Download and un-zip it.

Copy a compiled 'BatchXSLT.app' into the folder 'BatchXSLT4InDesign-rawApp/BatchXSLT/' (right beside the contained autostart.jt).\
The dummy folder named 'Replace with compiled BatchXSLT.app' can be deleted.

Now rename the folder 'BatchXSLT4InDesign-rawApp' to 'BatchXSLT4InDesign' and copy it into the 'Applications' folder.
The transformer is ready.
