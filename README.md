# BatchXSLT4InDesign
## An XML/HTML exporter and transformer for InDesign documents

BatchXSLT is a powerful XML transformer. It transforms any XML file to what ever the transform stylesheet commands.\
BatchXSLT can run in stand-alone mode or can be be remotely controlled.\
'Remotely controlled' means, that it can be controlled from any application capable to write Job Tickets. A Job Ticket is a human readable file which tells BatchXSLT what to do.\
InDesign scripting can write such files. It also can export documents to various formats like
- document content to IDML (XML)
- images to JPEG
- Pages to PDF
- and more...

After having exported a whole bunch of things from an document, InDesign can command BatchXSLT to create useful, readable XML from all these exported 'raw' files.

This combination of BatchXSLT controlled by InDesign demands for the package name:
#### BatchXSLT4InDesign

To download 'ready to run' binaries for Windows and Mac OS X enter the folder 'binaries'.

More is comming soon - working...
